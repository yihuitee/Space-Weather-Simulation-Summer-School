## Objectives

- Understand basic concepts of discretization of simple PDE models using finite differences.
- Be able to discretize a 1D elliptic problem (steady and transient).
- Learn how to model different kinds of boundary conditions and how to approximate them numerically.
- Get used to write and read code to solve PDEs numerically.
