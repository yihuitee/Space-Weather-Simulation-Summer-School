## Objectives

- Understand basic concepts of discretization of simple PDE models using finite differences.
- Be able to discretize a 1D convection-diffusion problem (steady and transient).
- Be able to discretize a 1D linear advection equation.
- Learn how to model different kinds of boundary conditions and how to approximate them numerically.
- Learn how to introduce different advective schemes, together with flux limiters.
- Get used to write and read code to solve PDEs numerically.
